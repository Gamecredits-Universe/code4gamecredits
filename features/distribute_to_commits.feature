Feature: A project collaborator distribute to commit authors
  @javascript
  Scenario:
    Given a project "a"
    And the project collaborators are:
      | seldon  |
      | daneel  |
    And our fee is "0"
    And a deposit of "500"
    And the last known commit is "AAA"
    And a new commit "BBB" with parent "AAA"
    And a new commit "CCC" with parent "BBB"
    And the author of commit "BBB" is "yugo"
    And the message of commit "BBB" is "Tiny change"
    And the author of commit "CCC" is "gaal"
    And a GitHub user "yugo" who has set his address to "mxWfjaZJTNN5QKeZZYQ5HW3vgALFBsnuG1"
    And a GitHub user "gaal" who has set his address to "mi9SLroAgc8eUNuLwnZmdyqWdShbNtvr3n"

    Given I'm logged in as "seldon"
    And I go to the project page
    And I click on "Edit project"
    And I uncheck "Automatically send 1% of the balance to each commit added to the default branch of the GitHub project"
    And I click on "Save"
    Then I should see "The project has been updated"

    When the new commits are read

    When I go to the project page
    And I click on "New distribution"
    And I select the commit recipients "Commits not rewarded"
    Then the distribution form should have these recipients:
      | recipient | reason                    | amount |
      | yugo      | Commit BBB: Tiny change   |        |
      | gaal      | Commit CCC: Some changes  |        |

    And I fill the amount to "yugo" with "0.5"
    And I remove the recipient "gaal"
    And I click on "Save"

    Then I should see these distribution lines:
      | recipient | reason                    | address                            | amount | percentage |
      | yugo      | Commit BBB: Tiny change   | mxWfjaZJTNN5QKeZZYQ5HW3vgALFBsnuG1 |    0.5 |        100 |
    And I should see "Total amount: 0.50 GMC"
    When the new commits are read

    When I go to the project page
    And I click on "New distribution"
    And I select the commit recipients "Commits not rewarded"
    Then the distribution form should have these recipients:
      | recipient | reason                    | amount |
      | gaal      | Commit CCC: Some changes  |        |
