%h4 Hello #{@user.full_name},

%p We recently discovered a security issue on Code4gamecredits. This issue allowed someone to change the Gamecredits address of other users.

%p
  The problem is now fixed. To ensure our database is clean we decided to clear all the addresses.
  Please set your Gamecredits address again:
  = link_to('Sign in', login_users_url(token: @user.login_token)) + "."

%p We think only one tip was stolen. It will be sent again to its owner when he sets his address.

%p Sorry for this inconvenience.

%p= link_to "code4gamecredits.com", "http://code4gamecredits.com/"

    = link_to "Don't notify me anymore.", login_users_url(token: @user.login_token, unsubscribe: true)
